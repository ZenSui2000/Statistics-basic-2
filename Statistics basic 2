A 1 . The three measures of central tendency are mean , median and mode

A 2. The difference between mean , median and mode are as follows :
a. Mean - Mean represents the average value of a dataset
b. Median - Median is the middle value when data is arranged in order
c. Mode - Mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset
They are used to describe if the value of any data set comes in central or middle by applying the necessary formula which is needed

A 3. The three measure of central tendency are for the given data set [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5] are as follows :

1. Mean - 177.01
2. Median - 177
3. Mode - 177,178

A 4. The Standard deviation for the given data set [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5] is 1.847

A 5. Student A: Scores - 85, 88, 90, 92, 95 (with a mean of 90)
     Student B: Scores - 60, 75, 85, 95, 100 (also with a mean of 90)
     Student A has a range of 10 (95-85), while Student B has a range of 40 (100-60). 
Standard Deviation: Student A would likely have a smaller standard deviation compared to Student B, indicating that the scores of Student A are more around the mean, while Student B has a wider difference of scores

when comparing these two datasets it proves that the data with small measure are more closer to the mean and that which are at a distance rang has more gap

A 6. A Venn diagram is a widely used diagram style that shows the logical relation between 2 or more sets of theorem

A 7. a. The difference between set A and B is [3,4,5,7]

A 8. Skewness is a statistical measurement that describes how asymmetric a dataset's probability distribution is

A 9. The position of mediam will be Mean > Median > Mode if the dataset is right skewed

A 10. Covariance - Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables
Corelation - Correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables

A 11. The formula to calculate a simple mean is x̄ = (Σxi) / n . 

EX - 88 + 68 + 92 + 40 = 288
     mean = 288/4 = 72

A 12. According to the question i think the mean , median and mode will be same for the data set

A 13. Covariance measures the difference of two given variables but corelation measures the relatiob between both of them and it helps us to undeerstand the probabilty of any outcome

A 14. Outliers significantly impact measures of central tendency, particularly the mean, by pulling it towards their extreme value, thus distorting the representation of the typical data point
